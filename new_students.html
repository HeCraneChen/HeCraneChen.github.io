          <h2>Suggestions for fresh Ph.D. students</h2>
          <br>
          <h4>General</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Ph.D. is very short, it's more about appearing at right location at right time than about who's smarter than whom. While I don't see myself as an authority or an exemplary figure in this domain, I've been reflecting on my own path and realized there are some insights I would have appreciated knowing sooner. With that in mind, I've compiled the following advice.</a> </p>
          <p>First, I point to a handbook from prof. Mark Dredze at Hopkins, the content of which I regret not reading earlier: </a> 
            <br>
            <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/publications/HowtoBeaSuccessfulPhDStudent.1_2.pdf">How to be a successful Ph.D. student</a></p>
          <p>Mark mentioned additional links at the bottom of his handbook. Here are the ones I believe are particularly noteworthy: </a> 
          <br>
          <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/ways-to-fail-a-phd/">10 easy ways to fail a Ph.D.</a><br>
          <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/">How to email</a><br>
          <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-find-research-problems.html">How to find research problems</a></p>
          <!-- <br> -->
          <p>Second, I stress several misleading suggestions I got from my early years, that I wish I never received.</a> </p>
          <p><i>``Teaching in general is a waste of time for research. You should fulfill the TA requirements with whatever course requiring minimum teaching workload, or TA the same course multiple times."</i></a> </p>
          <p>Teaching helps you learn and boosts research. Most likely, you will not be encouraged to teach after the requirements are fulfilled. If you're not sure which class to teach, chill and don't rush in your second year. Unless you need the TA cash, it is a terrible idea to TA the same class multiple times. Mix it up with different courses for cool teaching insights. </a> </p>
          <p><i>``Blah is a challenging research field. Considering the capable individuals who have not succeeded in this, it may be wise to avoid it."</i></a> </p>
          <p>Terrible idea. Maintaining curiosity is crucial. Difficulty should not deter one from making an attempt. People have varying perceptions of what is hard and what is easy. In my opinion, if something appears overly complex, it may be due to a lack of understanding.</a> </p>
          
          <br>
          <h4>For those studying computer graphics</h4>
          <br>
          
          <p>First, I'd like to direct your attention to a selection of online courses that merit multiple viewings. Even if you have already completed a course with the same title at your institution, these may still be worth exploring. Considered classics in the field, they are packed with insightful content. Individuals with diverse backgrounds can extract unique takeaways from these courses. Each time you revisit them, you may discover something new that you hadn't noticed before.</a> </p>

          <br>
          <p>Second, there are interesting resources I follow, that are not full lectures.</a> </p>

          </p> <a href="https://github.com/danielepanozzo/gp">Geometry Processing (Daniele Panozzo, NYU)</a><br>
          <br>
          <p>Last but not least, some universities come with a computer graphics track, but most don't. I view computer graphics as a multidisciplinary field in which computer science plays just one role among many. I want to recommend some hidden courses offered outside CS department that might be helpful for your career in computer graphics. You might want to consider taking <i>Differential Geometry</i> from applied math department, and <i>Fluid Mechanics</i>, <i>Heat Transfer</i> from mechanical/aero engineering department. </a> </p>
          
          <br>
          <h4>For those from underrepresented groups</h4>
          <br>
          <p>Unfortunately, the world can be unjust, with the majority often defining what is considered ``normal" for the rest of us. However, the silver lining is that it's possible to adopt a different viewpoint. This isn't about gaslighting yourself into believing that everything that occurs is fair, but rather about choosing the high road when faced with unfairness. </a><br>
          <p>I want to point to this profound speech by David Foster, recommended by Bill Gates on LinkedIn: </a> </p> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAd4HGJS4o">Your Mind is an Excellent Servant, but a Terrible Master (David Foster)</a><br>
          <br>
          <!-- <p>Minorities are more likely to overreact when facing miscommunications. If this is in person, knowing when to cut off a conversation is crucial. Cutting off in time before either party overreacted builds your credence. If this is through email, stick with email manners described in <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-email/">How to email</a>. Additional tips: (1) Never send/reply to emails around midnight. Because that's when you tend to be emotional and send something that you regret. Recalling emails damage your credence. (2) Never start or participate any debates through emails. This is a no-winner war. (This ``Never" includes extremely difficult situations, e.g. misunderstanding/discriminating/underappreciating.) Not only is this bad manner, there is no hope to solve the problem this way with too much space for miscommunication.</a><br>

          <p>While designing this website, I contemplated adopting a less feminine appearance by not including a photo and refraining from using pink or pastel shades. Perhaps I will get more citations that way ;)  However, I believe that feminism is for everyone, including scientists, and I aim to be a role model for younger female colleagues.</a><br>

          <h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
          <br>

          <p>In addition to research, I‚Äôve been developing my personal teaching philosophy and approaches in preparation for my future position at the lectern. I categorize teachers into three levels: The least effective teachers merely recite Wikipedia-based slides, providing no value to students. Slightly more effective teachers introduce high-level ideas but jump to derivations without context. Best teachers teach intuitions, which cannot be googled. This can also be considered as my learning philosophy, as teaching and learning are two sides of the same coin.</a> </p>
					
          <br>
          <h4>Intuition is more important than implementation details</h4>
          <br>

          <p>This is the most important teaching philosophy I got from my Ph.D. advisor prof. Misha Kazhdan. His memorable C++ intermediate programming course at Hopkins included a simple, clear explanation of segmentation faults: ‚ÄúIf you ran into this error, nine out of nine times it‚Äôs related to memory. You are touching memories that‚Äôs not yours". Simple and clear. I‚Äôll probably remember this lifetime. To elaborate the same concept, a bad teacher would just copy the Wikipedia definition ‚Äú In computing, a segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or access violation is a fault, or failure condition, raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system (OS) the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation). "</a> </p>

	  <!-- <br> -->
          <br>
          <h4>Interacting with students effectively is nontrivial</h4>
          <br>
          <p>This philosophy was again passed to me from my Ph.D. advisor Misha Kazhdan. I believe interaction with students is something sounds trivial but difficult to implement. Misha is such a good teacher, who would try to catch every single face that looks confused in the classroom and go after them. It is dangerous to say ‚ÄúUnderstood" in his classroom when he asks ‚ÄúUnderstand?". Admittedly, it was a bit intimidating at the beginning. But it has been very beneficial for students. That way, I stopped pretending a know-it-all, and learned more.</a> </p>

          <br>
          <h4>Learning happens when coding happens</h4>
          <br>
          <p>I appreciate heavy coding courses as a student. Talk is cheap in this field. The plan is to do the same for my students. Even for research, strong coding skills help you implement your ideas faster, that way you would be more productive.</a> </p>

	  <!-- <br> -->
          <br>
          <h4>Less is more</h4>
          <br>
          <p>This philosophy was passed to me from my father prof. Hongzhi Chen, amazing teacher in Electrical Engineering. I will keep in mind that not every single student in the classroom of Computer Graphics aims at becoming an expert in this narrower field or publishing SIGGRAPH papers. When planning my lessons, I contemplate which single concept I would like my students to retain if they could only remember one thing. For instance, in my rendition of Computer Graphics, the key takeaway from the entire lecture series would be the Laplacian. For my least motivated students, this serves as the baseline expectation. For those with a bit more drive, I strive to identify one enduring concept per lecture that they can commit to memory for a lifetime.</a> </p>

					<!-- <p>I am an enthusiast of images, surfaces, and volumes. I love my research. Computer Graphics is at the intersection of math, physics, and art. I cannot think of more exciting things to investigate than this. </p> 
          
          <p> I am trained in geometry for the second half of my PhD, for my thesis project. Before that, I was trained in 3d vision/robotics. All the trainings I received in those areas made sure I am good at observing and solving interesting real-world problems with the knowledge of geometry.</p>
					
					<p>I also devoted time to reading papers on diversity and inclusion, advocating for a welcoming work atmosphere that supports underrepresented communities in computer science and engineering. I served the position of social chair at <a href="https://gracejhu.github.io/">GRACE</a> and offered mentorship through <a href="https://wicsjhu.github.io/">WiCS</a> at Hopkins.</p>     -->
