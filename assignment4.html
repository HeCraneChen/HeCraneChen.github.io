        <h2>1. Digesting Codebase</h2>
        <p>
            Read the source code of Dynamic Kelvinlets and add comments and write a html format doc, to correspond the code with the theory we learned at the lectures. This might involve your reading through not just the slides but also the SIGGRAPH paper, and looking up bookchapters from the assigned reading as needed.
        </p>
    </p>
    <h3>Expected submission:</h3>
    <p>An html report that includes a big table. The table should include (1) Name of the class/struct/function hyperlink to the file and line number of the source code, (2) Variable types of it's input and it's output, (3) What is the specific class/struct/function doing? How does that relate to the paper/bookchapters.</p>
    <p>Well-commented source code.</p>

        <h2>2. Starting on your creative demo.</h2>
        <p>
            The goal is to create a deformation in Houdini, using the Dynamic Kelvinlets plugin. The deformatioin should aim to be as fun and creative as you can imagine.
        </p>
        <h3>Step1: Imagine.</h3>
        <p>What would be a cool animation you want to show others? From the in-class coding practice, we've seen other people come us with dancing elephant, deforming sponge, using rubber band to deform a duck ballon, moving the arms of an octupus, making the armadillo man dance. What else might be cool? What's your story?</p>
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Step2: Find a data you are interested in working with.</h3>
        <p>Could be any obj file of a 3D model that aligns with your story.</p>
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Step3: Implement it in Houdini.</h3>
        <p>You should start with double clicking the .hipnc file comes with Dynamic Kelvinlets. It loads a deformable square. Try to replace the unit test square with your story. Recall that in the lecture, we discussed translation, pinch, scale, twist. The force can be either an impulse or a push.</p>
